Task 1: Basic Bubble Sort and Array Search
1.1 Create an array with N = 1000 elements and fill it with random integers from -2000 to 2000.
1.2 Write a function for sorting using the bubble sort algorithm and sort the array in ascending order.
1.3 Write a function for linear search in the array, which returns the index of the found element or -1 if the element is not found.
1.4 Write a function for binary search in the array, which returns the index of the found element or -1 if the element is not found.
1.5 Compare the efficiency of search algorithms (search for random numbers in the array from -2000 to 2000), and test the correctness of the algorithms.

Task 2: Sorting with Elementary Algorithms by Different Criteria
2.1 Create an array with N = 200 elements and fill it with sequential numbers from 1 to N.
2.2 Write a function to shuffle the array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
2.3 Implement selection sort based on the criterion of the sum of digits of the number in ascending order (e.g., 61 < 53 because 7 < 8); in case of a tie, the smaller value comes first.

Task 3: Ternary Search and Golden Ratio
3.1 Implement the ternary search or golden ratio algorithm to find the minimum of the mathematical function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 in the interval [-100, 100] (variables a and b are input from the keyboard).
3.2 Verify your solution with tests on the system: https://www.e-olymp.com/uk/problems/10169 (registration on the website is required for submitting the solution).

Also GitHub has some issues with Cyrillic symbols, therefore, some comments and lines of code may not be displayed correctly.
